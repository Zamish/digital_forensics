Look at your command history.
Make a list of the major 4 overarching topics you predict will be on the 
semester exam.
	FLS
	XMOUNT
	GREP 
	MMLS
EXPLAIN why these are the 4 overaching topics.
	fls lists files and direcroty names in a disk image
	xmount tool to crossmount between miltiple input and output img files
	grep prints line matching a pattern
	mmls displays the partition value of a volume system
	These 4 topics overach because you need xmount to be able to edit or
	mess with a file, grep is used to find certain info within a file
	or directory, mmls to to show information about the volume system
	and fls to find the directories in a directory
	All these work together to get stuff done, they complement eachother..
Make a list of twenty commands and briefly describe (in your own words) what
each does 
	cat collects data in the file and outputs it as text
	pico allows you to edit text (very useful)
	cd moves into a directory
	ls shows the directories or files inside the current directory
	cp copies a file to whatever destination
	rm removes a file from the current directory
	mkdir makes a new directory
	beep write anything you wanna say and the computer will say it
	man shows you the manual or help for a command
	mmls this displays the partition values of a file 
	xmount mounts a file so you could use it
	icat outputs the data of file based on inode number
	fdisk allows you to change the partition stuff
	rmdir removes a directory
	clear clears (not) command history so it won't look messy
	locate is used to find files with ** and anythin inside it looks for
	last sees the history of logged users on the computer
	tac prints content of file as text but backwards
	strings prints strings of characters in files..
	killall...kills all of a command

It is strongly recommended that you work (relatively) independently as
duplicate text is penalized. [Overlapping commands are to be expected -but 
overlapping explanations are not.] OKAY :D
