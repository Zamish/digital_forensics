Describe output of following 4 commands...
	tcpdump -w capture.pcap -i eth1
		-w writes the raw packets into a file isntead of just printing them out -i uses the interface and ethernet port 1 :D
	tcpick -C -r capture.pcap
		-C uses terminal colors so it looks nice and organized and -r reads the packets from tcpdump
	tshark -n -r capture.pcap -T fields -r ip.dst_host -e frame.time_delta
		-r disables network object name resolution and reads it from a certain time	
	tcptrace --tsv -xHTTP -f ''port=80'' -btn capture.pcap
		this is a traffic capture thing and ti traces the http so find websites and such	
	tcpdump -ttttnr acpture.pcap	
		this prints a timestamp without converting addresses
