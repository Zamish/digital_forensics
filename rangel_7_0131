Today I did....
	I tried to get images from the first file which was Charlie-2009-11-18.E01 but failed... i tried to grep for jpg or png and there were many images that were there
	too many to look through.. so I started to look through journals that had the mactime files and i finally found it but it's way too late to analyze it.
