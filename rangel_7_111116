Craft a narrative describing how bluetooth could be used to compromise network
	Once upon a time, there was a toddler playing with a tablet and
	accidentally turns on the bluetooth and automatically pairs to a 
	tv of a neighbor... the neighbor will then get notified and is able
	to obtain addresses that he should'nt be able to have and use that to
	connect with a different device such as a phone which can then take
	control of the tablet and by that it can go to the browser, log in
	to the router, and mess with it and maybe shut it down, change the
	password or completely break it.
