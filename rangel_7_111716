1) fls is a tool for images that does anywhere from dispaying file, 
	directories or entries to recurse, print version and imoffset
	it basically shows the addons 
2) -i displays the format of the image file. ewf is an enhanced write filter.
	it shows the slot start end and length and description...
	We typed ewf because it is an enhanced write filter it helped to 
	filter things... 
3) -r made it output recursive directory entries -i made it output the 
	format of the image -o  is the img offset... this outputed a lot
	of files with extentions like dll exe xsd sys and inf.
4) A body file is an intermediate file that is created when you create a 
	timeline of file activity which contains one line for each line...
5) -m displays the output in mactime input format so the output was a lot
	of random code.
6) This put it in a file named bodyfile.txt
7) Inside the bodyfile.txt there are random codes and data, you can't tell 
	anything from the file.
8) -r recursively prints the directory entries
9) -m displays output in mactime input format with /dir as the actual 
	mount point of the image
10) -b specifies the body file location. This outputs another file with 
	extention of csv
11) CHECK 
12)-r finish this
