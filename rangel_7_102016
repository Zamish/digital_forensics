1) a disk image is an exact copy of a storage device
2) dd
3) a disk partition is regions in a storage which is made so the OS can 
handle info separately
4) A disk can have up to 4 main partitions and an extended one, but they can
 have more...up to 6... it depends...
5) Any difficulties would just be the set up of them, other than that, they 
are pretty much helpful
6) it is quite easy to set up disk partitions for example in windows 10 you 
would use windows key + x to open power user task menu > run option and type
diskmgmt.msc and enter to take you to the set up.
