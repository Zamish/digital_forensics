Try out this command:

tcpdump -s0 -X dst port 80

What does it do?
it dumps a file with a set size with data packets in hex from destination port 80 which is an internet client.

Why '-s0'?
"snapshot length" 0 sets it to default which is 65535, basically limits the size so the output isn't as much and only to find what you are looking for.

What is '-X' for?
in addition to printing the headers, prints data of each packet except link in both hex and and ASCII

What does 'dst' do?
destination IP addresses and ports

Why port 80?
port 80 is the port that a server expects to receive from a Web client. (from http)
